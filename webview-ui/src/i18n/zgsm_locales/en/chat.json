	"aboutMe": "Thanks to the latest breakthroughs in agentic coding capabilities, I can handle complex software development tasks step-by-step. With tools that let me create & edit files, explore complex projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), I can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support. I can even use MCP to create new tools and extend my own capabilities.",
